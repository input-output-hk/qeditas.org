<h2>Spin-Off and Snapshot</h2>

<h3>Qeditas is a <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0" target="_blank">Bitcoin Spin-Off</a> in the sense of <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0" target="_blank">Peter R's thread</a>:</h3>

The current plan was to take a <a href="https://mega.nz/#!IkBUzT5A!P4Ea4zLiJtnzFTHyqxyiNFZ00_N3E45Ra6LmFoVqCao" target="_blank">snapshot of the Bitcoin block chain</a> up to (not including) the block at height 350,000. At that point 2/3 of the Bitcoin distribution was complete. This block should be published on (approximately) March 31, 2015. If you had bitcoins under your (sole) control, then you have a corresponding initial distribution in Qeditas. Your part of the initial distribution is easiest to claim if it is in an ordinary pay-to-public-key-hash (p2pkh) address.
